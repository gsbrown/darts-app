// const targetIcon = "üéØ"; // Already ICON_DART_TARGET
// const skullIcon = "üíÄ";   // If used elsewhere

// It's good practice to ensure these are available if scripts are loaded in a way
// that doesn't use ES modules (which is your current HTML setup).
// However, Parcel might handle this if app.js imports this file and game components import from app.js.
// For direct script loading in HTML, these will be global.
